	abstract = {In this paper we propose and analyze a novel multilevel version of Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). SVGD is a recent particle based variational inference method. For Bayesian inverse problems with computationally expensive likelihood evaluations, the method can become prohibitive as it requires to evolve a discrete dynamical system over many time steps, each of which requires likelihood evaluations at all particle locations. To address this, we introduce a multilevel variant that involves running several interacting particle dynamics in parallel corresponding to different approximation levels of the likelihood. By carefully tuning the number of particles at each level, we prove that a significant reduction in computational complexity can be achieved. As an application we provide a numerical experiment for a PDE driven inverse problem, which confirms the speed up suggested by our theoretical results.},
